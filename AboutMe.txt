I am a 3rd year here at UNCG, majoring in Computer
Science. Some of my hobbies include playing video games,
spending time at the gym, and playing tennis occasionally.
Some of the games that I play include League of Legends,
Valorant and Rainbow Six Siege to name a few. I hope that
I am able to become friends with you all during this course.
